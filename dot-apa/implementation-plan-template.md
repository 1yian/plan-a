# APA (Always Plan Ahead) – APM Implementation Plan
**Memory Strategy:** Dynamic-MD
**Last Modification:** Plan creation by the Setup Agent.
**Project Overview:** Fork APM into APA with Claude Code native subagent integration. Replace manual copy-paste workflows with Task tool for automatic agent spawning. Create 6 slash commands (/apa.init, .plan, .implement, .status, .resume, .reassess), 2 hooks (PreCompact, Stop), and adapt guides for branch-specific execution with constitution enforcement. Development uses dot-claude/ and dot-apa/ directories to avoid modifying the active APM session.
