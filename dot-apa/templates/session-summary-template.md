# Session Summary

**Date**: [ISO 8601 timestamp]
**Branch**: [Branch name]
**Status**: [Completed | Partial | Paused for Reassessment]

## Execution Metrics

- **Total Tasks**: [number]
- **Completed**: [number]
- **Failed**: [number]
- **Blocked**: [number]
- **Success Rate**: [percentage]

## Key Findings

[Synthesized findings from across all completed tasks. Include:]
- Important discoveries that weren't known during planning
- Technical constraints or capabilities discovered
- Assumptions that were validated or invalidated
- Emergent patterns or insights

## Common Failure Patterns

[If any tasks failed multiple times, document the patterns:]
- **Pattern**: [Description of failure type]
- **Affected Tasks**: [Task IDs]
- **Root Cause**: [Analysis]
- **Resolution**: [How it was resolved, or why it remains blocked]

## Performance Notes

[Observations about task execution:]
- Average time per task type
- Tasks that took significantly longer than expected
- Tasks that were simpler than expected
- Resource constraints encountered

## Blockers Requiring Resolution

[List any unresolved blockers that need attention:]
- **Task X.Y**: [Description of blocker]
- **Root Cause**: [Analysis]
- **Impact**: [What depends on this]
- **Recommended Action**: [How to resolve]

## Recommendations for Future Planning

[Based on this execution session, what should be considered in future planning?]
- Planning assumptions that should be adjusted
- Task complexity estimates that should be revised
- Dependencies that should be structured differently
- Phases that should be broken down differently
- Areas where more upfront research would help

## Phase Summaries

### Phase X: [Phase Title]

**Status**: [Completed | Partial]
**Tasks**: [completed]/[total]

**Outcome**: [Brief summary of what was accomplished]

**Key Findings**: [Phase-specific discoveries]
